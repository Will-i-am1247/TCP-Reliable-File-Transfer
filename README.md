# TCP Reliable File Transfer

## Description
Implementation of a reliable file transfer client over TCP, focusing on protocol reliability concepts such as acknowledgments, sequencing, and retransmissions.

## Technologies
- C / C++
- TCP/IP
- Socket Programming
- Linux / Unix

## Key Concepts
- Reliable data transfer
- Packet sequencing
- Acknowledgment handling
- Retransmission on loss
- Client-server communication
- Network error handling

## Overview
This project implements a client for reliable file transfer over a TCP connection. The program sends file data while ensuring reliability through acknowledgments and retransmissions, demonstrating how transport-layer guarantees are achieved in practice.

## Features
- Establishes a TCP connection using sockets
- Transfers file data reliably
- Handles packet loss and retransmission
- Ensures ordered delivery of data

## Notes
This project was completed as part of a computer networks course and is intended to demonstrate core networking and transport-layer concepts rather than production-level performance.
